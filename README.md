# Setup
First download the Open-Sourced ViolentMonkey Extension for your browser of choice here:
https://violentmonkey.github.io/

Note: ViolentMonkey is an opensource version of the now slightly antiquated GreaseMonkey Extension. You can also use Tampermonkey or any other derivative of greasemonkey, just might require some code tweaking.

Then open the .user.js file in this repository in your browser to add it to ViolentMonkey. Additionally, you could copy the code over into violentmonkey by creating a new script.
